### TODO: 

5. Present all this data in a sexy manner (consider switching to python at this point)

Real time will be probably done on python, implementing/rewriting these methods in python obviously

4. Add article gathering script
	4.1. Make it learn which articles are usefull and which aren't
	4.2. In the long run, sort it out and present only usefull articles
	4.3. Gather articles on stock market as a whole (not related to a particular stock)
	
	
Thought process. Set up a server(github?) which stores everything from R and python (pictures, indicators, etc.) and html/android would just load from there instead of running scripts n shit.
